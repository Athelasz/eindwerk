faker_file

faker_file.main()

   This script is used to generate testing data to use when running
   the create_meetings script.  Itâ€™s important to assure that email
   addresses in the hostEmaillist are ACTUAL (test) users in your
   environment. The invitees can be bogus  but fake hosts WILL cause
   an error.

   The file generated will have a *fake_* prefix to not accidentaly
   overwrite the default file. Take this into account when running
   create_meetings. Happy Testing :)
